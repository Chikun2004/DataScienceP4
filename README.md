# Email-spam-Detection-using-Machine-learning
 This is basically a Data Science Intern project from Oasis Infobyte. In this the Machine Learning concept along with Python language is used to detect the Spam Mail in a CSV file
We’ve all been the recipient of spam emails before. Spam mail, or junk mail, is a type of email
that is sent to a massive number of users at one time, frequently containing cryptic
messages, scams, or most dangerously, phishing content.



In this Project, use Python to build an email spam detector. Then, use machine learning to
train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam. Let’s get
started!
